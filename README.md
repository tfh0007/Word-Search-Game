# About This Project

- This project is an extension to the Boogle Word Search game created for a Java II Class

# How the Project was Expanded and What was Learned

- Learned how to create graphical interfaces using Jframes
- Used action listeners to make the program interactable
- Used exception handeling to deal with invalid user entries
- Used visuals and sound effects to make the experience complete
- Made the values in the word search table customizable
- Allowed the user to choose different table sizes as well as use different Lexicon listings

# What was Learned in the Original Class Project
- Used Lexicon dictionaries and stored the values into a Sorted Set of strings
- Used a depth first search algorithm to search for valid words on the generated board
- Used 2 dimensional arrays to create the board
- Used various functions for checking what neighbors existed near the current position
- Used a scoreboard to keep track of the users correct responses
