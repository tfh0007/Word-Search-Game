# About This Project

This project is an extension to the Boogle Word Search game I created for my Java II Class

# How the Project was Expanded and What I Learned

- Learned how to create graphical interfaces using Jframes
- Used action listeners to make the program interactable
- Used exception handeling to deal with invalid user entries
- Used visuals and sound effects to make the experience complete
- Made the values in the word search table customizable
- Allowed the user to choose different table sizes as well as use different Lexicon listings
