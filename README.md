# About this proejct

Is an extension to the Boogle Word Search game I created for my Java II Class

# What I Expanded and Learned

- Learned how to create graphical interfaces using Jframes
- Used action listeners to make the program interactable
- Had to use exception handeling to deal with invalid user entries
- Used custom visuals and sound effects to make the experience complete
- Made the values in the word search table customizable
- Allowed the user to choose diffrent table sizes as well as use different Lexicon listings
